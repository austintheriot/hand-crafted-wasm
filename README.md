# Raw WebAssembly

## Conway's Game Of Life: 1240 bytes

An implementation of the classic Conway's Game Of Life, written entirely in hand-crafted WebAssembly.

[See live demo](https://austintheriot.github.io/raw-wasm/src/life/)

## Perlin Noise: 428 bytes

A rasterized perlin noise field rendered in WebAssembly. Uses the P5.js perlin noise implementation, but perhaps I'll re-implement their Perlin noise function in pure WebAssembly as well soon.

[See live demo](https://austintheriot.github.io/raw-wasm/src/noise/)
